Provides functions for parity checking.

Determining the parity of integers is a difficult task. Howecver, as a service to the reader we provide the following function.
The function *returnTrueIfOdd* returns *true* if applied to an odd integer. As a supplement, the function *returnTrueIfNotOdd* returns *true* if applied to an integer that isn't odd. Also, same functions are provided for checking even numbers - *returnTrueIfEven*, *returnTrueIfNotEven*.

The author has formally verified that these functions satisfy their specifications.
